Our technology stack is powered by Symfony, Doctrine, MongoDB, and MySQL on the backend. The frontend is powered by Backbone, RequireJS, and Foundation. We use npm for JavaScript dependency management and Composer for PHP dependency management. We use Gulp as our front-end task manager.</p>

                <p>I have several ongoing <a href="{{ path('projects') }}">side projects</a>, but when I'm not working on something code-related, I like to spend my free time outdoors, often times with the dog, Theo. My favorite outdoor activities involve big mountains and snow. I've been a snowboarder and skier for over 14 years and during the summer months, I enjoy spending lots of time hiking, camping, and golfing.</p>
